# Configuration

The adapter has no options of its own; all security tuning is engine
configuration via `RenzoFranceschini\GuardCore\Config\SecurityConfig`. See the
[guard-core-php source](https://github.com/rennf93/guard-core-php/tree/master/src/Config/SecurityConfig.php)
for the full surface.

## Minimal tuned setup

```php
$config = new SecurityConfig(
    enableRedis: true,
    redisPrefix: 'guard_core:',
    redisFailOpen: true,
    enableRateLimiting: true,
    rateLimit: 30,
    rateLimitWindow: 60,
    endpointRateLimits: [
        '/rate/strict' => ['limit' => 1, 'window' => 10],
    ],
    enableIpBanning: true,
    autoBanThreshold: 5,
    autoBanDuration: 300,
    customErrorResponses: [403 => 'Blocked by symfony-guard'],
    excludePaths: ['/health'],
);
```

Endpoint rate limits are keyed by URL path and override the global limit for
those paths. `excludePaths` matches a path exactly or as a directory prefix.

## Redis

Distributed bans and rate limits require Redis:

```php
$config = new SecurityConfig(
    enableRedis: true,
    redisPrefix: 'guard_core:',
);
```

The engine connects to `REDIS_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`) and `REDIS_PORT`
(default `6379`) from the environment. With `redisFailOpen: true` the
middleware constructs and serves requests even when Redis is unreachable; with
`redisFailOpen: false` construction fails closed. Without Redis the managers
fall back to in-process state, which does not share across replicas.

## Excluded detection headers

The Python and Go engines expose an `ExcludedDetectionHeaders` surface that
skips suspicious-content scanning for address headers (`host`,
`x-forwarded-for`, `x-real-ip`, ...). The PHP port does not have that surface
yet: every header value is scanned like any other input. The `ssrf` category
in particular flags benign `Host` headers (for example `localhost:8080`) on
every request. Until the surface is ported, either disable that one category
explicitly, as the runnable examples do:

```php
$config = new SecurityConfig(
    enabledDetectionCategories: array_values(
        array_diff(SecurityConfig::DETECTION_CATEGORIES, ['ssrf'])
    ),
    // ...
);
```

or strip and normalize address headers at your proxy. Do not try to mutate the
request inside the middleware, the adapter does not support it.

## Body inspection

`PsrGuardRequest::MAX_BODY_BYTES` (256 KiB, matching the engine's full-scan
window) bounds what the detector sees. Bodies larger than the limit are still
forwarded to your handler; only the inspected prefix is truncated, and
signatures split across the boundary are not detected. The bound is deliberate
and engine-coupled; do not widen it in consumer code.

## Trusted proxies

When behind a reverse proxy, trust only the proxy hop so the engine resolves
the real client IP from forwarded headers:

```php
$config = new SecurityConfig(
    trustedProxies: ['172.16.0.0/12', '10.0.0.0/8'],
    trustedProxyDepth: 1,
    // ...
);
```
